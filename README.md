# OAAR Reference Implementation

Reference implementation of the [Observability Architecture for Agentic Runtimes (OAAR) RFC](https://github.com/Carniatto-Labs/oaar) on a real durable agent runtime (LangGraph 1.0, Temporal planned as second framework).

**Status:** phase 5 complete — all five runtime scenarios validated on a real durable runtime. Earlier phases: three-denominator ABC validation (phase 4, `make abc-smoke` / `make abc-unknown-smoke`, 8/8 PASS each), langgraph checkpoint adapter (phase 3, 6/6), pipeline smoke (5/5).

Phase 5 scenarios (each `make <target>` = demo + automated verification against Tempo/Prometheus/Loki):

| Scenario | Target | Validates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human-in-the-loop resume | `make hitl-smoke` (5/5) | `agent.run.waiting` is a distinct lifecycle event — a run parked for human approval is not a failure; resume restores the exact waiting checkpoint (`resume` link + checkpoint age measured from telemetry) |
| Compensation saga | `make saga-smoke` (3/3) | Partial rollback after mid-flight failure: confirmed effect span + `compensates` link from the compensation span, `agent.compensation.outcome=partial`, compensation rate metrics |
| Delegation fan-out | `make fanout-smoke` (4/4) | Parent/child execution identity: `parent_run.id` on children, `delegates_to` + `aggregates` links from parent to both child traces |
| Guardrail block | `make guardrail-smoke` (4/4) | Pre-execution block → `agent.run.cancelled` (not failed); guardrail evaluation span; sensitive source content provably absent from traces AND logs |
| MCP retry + idempotent dedup | `make mcp-smoke` (5/5) | W3C trace context propagation to an MCP server, retry correlation via `retries` link, deduplication observable per attempt (`agent.tool.deduplication.status`) |

## Purpose

1. Validate every normative requirement of RFC 0.1.0 (Run identity, lifecycle, checkpoints, decisions, tools/MCP, external effects, compensation, causality links, metrics, privacy, collection architecture).
2. Validate experimentally the distinctions raised in [Discussion #1](https://github.com/Carniatto-Labs/Observability-Architecture-for-Agentic-Runtimes/discussions/1): execution identity vs. logical outcome identity, three-level outcomes, and metric denominators (unit, cohort, window, finality).

## The validation question

If Run A checkpoints and fails, and Run B restores and completes the same work:

| Denominator | Result |
|---|---|
| Execution completion (Runs) | 2/3 |
| Artifact production (operations) | 2/2 |
| Customer acceptance (proposals) | 1/2 |

This repository exists to demonstrate and test those distinctions on a production-grade runtime before the RFC standardizes any attribute names for them.

TBD (will match the OAAR spec repository).
